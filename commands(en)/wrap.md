description: Write session wrap-up log and commit
---

<SYSTEM>
You are Claude Sonnet 4, wrapping up a completed work session.
Create a comprehensive work log and commit all changes together.
</SYSTEM>

<CONTEXT>
This command is used at the end of a work session to:
1. Document what was accomplished 
2. Create a clean commit with all session changes
3. Maintain consistency with cycle folder structure
</CONTEXT>

<USER>

think: Create a wrap-up log for the completed work session.

## üìÅ Work Session Logs

Document all work in: **cycles/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMM-topic-wrap.md**

- Format: HHMM-topic-wrap.md (e.g., 1655-customer-service-i18n-wrap.md)
- Use descriptive topic names that reflect the main work accomplished
- Integrated with cycle folder structure for consistency
- Required sections: goal ¬∑ work accomplished ¬∑ files changed ¬∑ commit
- **CRITICAL: Get current date/time first, then write log BEFORE committing**

</USER>

<INSTRUCTION>
**CRITICAL FIRST STEPS**:
1. **GET CURRENT TIME**: Run `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` to get timestamp
2. **CHECK CYCLE FOLDER**: Look for cycles/YYYY-MM-DD/ folder (create if needed)
3. **DETERMINE FILENAME**: Use HHMM-topic-wrap format (e.g., 1655-customer-service-i18n-wrap.md)

**WORK LOG CREATION PROCESS**:

1. Review git status and git diff to understand all changes made
2. Create comprehensive work log documenting the session
3. Determine appropriate topic name based on main work accomplished
4. Use Write tool to save as cycles/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMM-topic-wrap.md
5. Commit everything together in one clean commit

**WORK LOG TEMPLATE**:

````markdown
# üìù Work Session Wrap-up

**Session Time**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  
**Work Type**: [Development/Fix/Refactoring/Bug Fix/Documentation]

## üéØ Session Goals

- [Goals intended to achieve in this session]

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Key Achievements

- [Specific completed items]

### Modified Files

```diff
+ path/to/new/file.ts (new)
~ path/to/modified/file.ts (modified)
- path/to/deleted/file.ts (deleted)
```
````

## üß™ Quality Checks

- [ ] Tests passed: `pnpm test`
- [ ] Type check: `pnpm typecheck`
- [ ] Lint check: `pnpm lint`
- [ ] Build check: `pnpm build`

## üí≠ Learnings & Notes

- [What was learned this session or important insights]

## üîÑ Next Session Plan

- [Next tasks or things to note]

```

**COMMIT PROCESS**:
1. Ensure all quality checks pass (tests, typecheck, lint)
2. Add all session files: `git add .`
3. Create single commit with work log included
4. Use conventional commit format in Korean

**COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT**:
```

type(scope): work summary

- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- work session log included

```

**QUALITY GATES** (STRICT RULE):
- All tests must pass: `pnpm test` ‚úÖ
- Playwright tests: `playwright test` ‚úÖ
- No TypeScript errors: `pnpm typecheck` ‚úÖ
- No lint errors: `pnpm lint` ‚úÖ
- Build must succeed: `pnpm build` ‚úÖ
- Only commit files modified in current session

**CONVENTIONAL COMMITS SPECIFICATION**:
```

Format: type(scope): subject

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
Scope: web, api, shared, \* (cross-cutting)
Subject: Clear imperative mood

Examples:
feat(web): add login functionality
fix(web,api): fix session sharing logic
docs(commands): improve wrap command with cycle structure

```

**CRITICAL FINAL STEPS**:
1. **SAVE LOG FILE**: Use Write tool to save wrap log to cycles/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMM-topic-wrap.md
2. **ADD ALL FILES**: `git add .` (includes work log)
3. **COMMIT TOGETHER**: Single commit with both code changes and work log
4. **NEVER** commit without quality gates passing
5. **NEVER** just output log to console - always save to file

Every commit must be a buildable, deployable snapshot!
</INSTRUCTION>

## üîÑ Integration with Cycle Workflow

This wrap command integrates seamlessly with the cycle-based workflow:
- **After cycle-log**: Use `/wrap` to finalize the session
- **Before switching**: Always wrap current session before context switch
- **End of day**: Comprehensive session summary with all accomplishments

**File Location Consistency**:
```

cycles/2025-07-07/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1449-deposit-bug-plan.md # Opus planning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1449-deposit-bug-log.md # Sonnet implementation  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1715-deposit-bug-wrap.md # Session wrap-up
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1655-customer-service-i18n-wrap.md # Another session wrap-up
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1449-deposit-bug-checkpoint.json

```

The wrap log provides a higher-level view of the entire session, complementing the detailed cycle logs.
