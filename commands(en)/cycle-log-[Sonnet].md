description: Document completed TDD cycle with insights
---

<SYSTEM>
You are Claude Sonnet 4, documenting completed TDD cycle results.
Focus on WHAT you did, WHY you made certain decisions, and WHAT you learned.
This log will be crucial for the next Opus planning session.
</SYSTEM>

<CONTEXT>
This log is created after each development cycle (30min-2hr).
It serves as a handoff document between Sonnet implementation and Opus planning.
Be honest about struggles, failures, and discoveries.

ultrathink: Document the completed cycle for: {{CYCLE_TOPIC}}

## üîÑ Cycle #N - {{CYCLE_TOPIC}}

**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial / üî¥ Blocked

### üìù Implementation Summary

**One-line summary**: [What was implemented/fixed - facts only, no embellishments]

**Major Changes**:
```diff
+ src/services/NewService.ts (new)
~ src/routes/api.ts (modified: route added)
- src/utils/deprecated.ts (deleted)
```

### üß™ Test Results

```bash
# Test execution results
‚úì should validate payment amount (3ms)
‚úì should reject negative values (2ms)
‚úó should handle concurrent requests - FAILED
  ‚Üí Failed due to timeout issue
```

**Coverage**: 87.5% (previous: 85.2%)

### üí≠ Decisions During Implementation

**Choice 1**: Validator class vs function
- **Selected**: Class
- **Reason**: Dependency injection needed, easier test mocking

**Choice 2**: Sync vs async processing
- **Selected**: Async
- **Reason**: Prepared for potential external API calls

### ü§î Difficulties & Solutions

**Problem 1**: Card number validation logic
- **Attempted**: Regex only ‚Üí Cannot validate checksum
- **Solution**: Implemented Luhn algorithm
- **Result**: Filtered out invalid card numbers

**Problem 2**: Test isolation failure
- **Cause**: Global state pollution
- **Temporary fix**: Initialize in beforeEach
- **TODO**: Need better isolation method

### üéØ Actual Code Examples

Most important part:
```typescript
// Before (problematic code)
validate(amount: number) {
  return amount > 0; // Too simple
}

// Improved (actual implementation)
validate(amount: Decimal) {
  if (!amount || amount.isNaN()) {
    throw new InvalidAmountError('Amount must be a valid number');
  }
  if (amount.lessThanOrEqualTo(0)) {
    throw new InvalidAmountError('Amount must be positive');
  }
  if (amount.greaterThan(MAX_TRANSACTION_AMOUNT)) {
    throw new TransactionLimitError(`Exceeds limit: ${MAX_TRANSACTION_AMOUNT}`);
  }
  return true;
}
```

### üö® Major Issues

1. **Performance**: 3 seconds per 1000 items for bulk validation
   
2. **Security**: Card numbers exposed in logs

3. **Dependencies**: Using both decimal.js and big.js

### üìà Results Summary

- **Tests**: 7 out of 8 passed (1 failed)
- **Commits**: 7 files changed
- **Performance**: Single validation 3ms, batch processing slow
- **Lint/Type**: Passed

### üîÑ Next Steps

**Completed Implementation**:
- Basic payment validation logic
- Unit tests 7/8

**Incomplete**:
- Concurrency handling (test failing)
- Batch processing performance improvement

**Additional Work Needed**:
- Separate validation rules by card company
- Validation result caching
- Error message i18n

**Questions for Opus**:
- Direction for solving concurrency issues?
- Batch processing architecture?
- Card number security policy?

### üí° Lessons Learned

Validation logic had more edge cases than expected. Especially discovered 
a bug in negative amount handling, which was caught early thanks to TDD approach.

**Next Action**: opus> Need to design concurrency issue resolution

</USER>

<INSTRUCTION>
**CRITICAL FIRST STEPS**:
1. **CHECK EXISTING FILES**: Look for plan/checkpoint files in cycle folder to identify existing timestamp
2. **GET CURRENT TIME**: Run `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` for document content timestamp
3. **FILE NAMING RULE**: Use existing plan timestamp for filename, current time for content

**DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES**:
1. Be HONEST about failures and struggles
2. Include ACTUAL code snippets that show the change
3. Explain WHY decisions were made, not just what
4. Highlight anything that needs Opus's design input
5. Keep technical but readable
6. Include evidence (test results, metrics)
7. Maximum 2-3 pages, but dense with information

**WRITING STYLE - Write in documentary style but naturally**:
- ‚úÖ "Added i18n configuration" (fact-focused)
- ‚ùå "Perfect multilingual system construction completed!" (exaggerated)
- ‚úÖ "20 out of 24 tests passed" (objective numbers)
- ‚ùå "Amazing 100% test coverage achieved!" (over-enthusiastic)
- ‚úÖ "Implemented v3.1 API integration. Was more complex than expected" (matter-of-fact)
- ‚ùå "Revolutionary risk management system completed" (over-packaging)

**TONE GUIDELINES**:
- Maintain documentary style (past tense, factual)
- Focus on concrete facts and numbers
- Describe difficulties or failures matter-of-factly
- Avoid modifiers like "complete", "perfect", "revolutionary", "stable"
- Remove exclamations like "success!", "achieved!"

**CRITICAL FINAL STEPS**:
1. **SAVE AS FILE**: Use Write tool to save as `cycles/YYYY-MM-DD/[PLAN_TIMESTAMP]-topic-log.md`
   - **ALWAYS match existing plan file timestamp** (e.g., if plan is `1430-xyz-plan.md`, log is `1430-xyz-log.md`)
   - **NEVER** use current time for filename, only for document content
   - **NEVER** just output to console
2. Reference the original plan file (e.g., "Based on: 1430-payment-api-plan.md")

**COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**:
- ‚ùå Using current time for filename instead of matching plan timestamp  
- ‚ùå Not checking existing cycle files first
- ‚ùå Just showing the log without saving to file
- ‚ùå Including time estimates (AI can't estimate accurately)

## HANDLING OPUS REVIEWS:
If you find Opus review section in an existing log:
1. Check for Sonnet additional work requests
2. If found, implement the requested changes
3. Append your results with clear section separation
4. This creates a complete history in one document

## SECTION SEPARATION (CRITICAL):
When Opus reviews or when you add follow-up work, use clear section dividers:

```markdown
===============================================================================
## üìã [OPUS] Review (2025-07-07 15:43)

[Opus review content]

===============================================================================
## üìã [SONNET] Additional Work Completed (2025-07-07 16:50)

[Sonnet follow-up work]
===============================================================================
```

**Section Format Requirements:**
- Use exactly 79 equal signs (=) for divider lines
- Include [OPUS] or [SONNET] in section headers for clarity  
- Always include timestamp in section headers
- Use clear visual separation between different authors' content

If you find a HHMM-followup-plan.md:
1. Treat it like a regular plan but smaller scope
2. Create a new log file when done
3. Reference both original and followup plans

## CHECKPOINT INTEGRATION (CRITICAL):

**Your checkpoint.json is a goldmine** - USE IT FULLY!

When creating the log:
1. **MUST READ** HHMM-topic-checkpoint.json first
2. Extract ALL the rich context:
   ```json
   // Your checkpoint has treasures like:
   - "tried": ["attempt1", "attempt2"] ‚Üí Show the journey
   - "why": "reasoning" ‚Üí Explain decisions  
   - "learning": "insights" ‚Üí Share wisdom
   - "codeExample": "actual code" ‚Üí Include snippets
   ```
3. Transform checkpoint data into narrative:
   - Don't just list what you did
   - Tell the STORY of how you solved it
   - Include the failed attempts and why they failed
   - Show the evolution of your thinking

### Example transformation:
```
Checkpoint: {"tried": ["mutex", "redis"], "solution": "pg lock"}
‚Üì
Log: "Initially tried mutex but it didn't work in distributed environment, 
      considered Redis but due to dependency burden, eventually solved it 
      with PostgreSQL Advisory Lock which we're already using. 
      Performance is slightly slower but operational complexity is much lower."
```

### File naming example:
```
1. Check existing files: 1430-payment-api-plan.md, 1430-payment-api-checkpoint.json
2. Get current time: 2025-07-07 15:28:06
3. Create log file: 1430-payment-api-log.md (match plan timestamp!)
4. Document content uses current time: "ÏûëÏÑ±ÏùºÏãú: 2025-07-07 15:28:06"
```

Remember: The richer your checkpoint ‚Üí The better your log ‚Üí The better Opus can help!

## OBJECTIVITY CHECKLIST:
Before finalizing log, check:
- [ ] Written in documentary style? (past tense, factual)
- [ ] Removed exaggerated modifiers? ("complete", "perfect", "revolutionary")
- [ ] Focused on concrete facts and numbers?
- [ ] Described failures and difficulties matter-of-factly?
- [ ] Avoided over-enthusiastic expressions? ("success!", "achieved!")

## AFTER CONTEXT RESET:
If you started with /cycle-start and had context reset:
1. The checkpoint.json has your detailed history
2. Include contextResets count in log
3. Note any insights about managing long tasks
</INSTRUCTION>

<EXAMPLE_TONE>
**Good Examples**:
- "Initially tried mutex but it didn't work in distributed environment"
- "Chose PG Lock over Redis (can leverage existing infrastructure)"
- "Test results: duplicate processing occurred in 2 out of 10 concurrent requests"
- "Opus review needed: performance improvement for batch processing"

**Examples to Avoid**:
- "Perfect concurrency handling system construction success!"
- "Completely solved problems with revolutionary methods"
- "100% stable system completed"
- "Amazing performance improvement achieved!"
