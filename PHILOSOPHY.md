# ðŸŒŸ Resonance Philosophy

## Core Philosophy: The Fundamental Shift

Traditional AI coding and Resonance represent fundamentally different approaches to software development with AI.

### Traditional AI Coding
- **Approach**: "Build X" â†’ AI dumps code â†’ Test â†’ Error â†’ Fix â†’ Repeat...
- **Problem**: AI guesses what you want without understanding why
- **Result**: Endless debugging cycles, context loss, frustration

### Resonance Workflow
- **Approach**: "Build X" â†’ Understand why â†’ Design tests â†’ Implement â†’ Review
- **Philosophy**: Understanding before implementation, tests before code
- **Result**: Higher quality, fewer iterations, preserved context

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Understanding First (Opus Phase 1)
- Ask "why" before "what"
- Natural dialogue over templates
- Thorough understanding over quick starts
- Quality over speed

### 2. Test-Driven Development (Always)
- Tests define behavior before implementation
- RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR cycle
- No exceptions for "simple" features
- Tests are documentation

### 3. Context Preservation (Checkpoints)
- Your checkpoint is your external brain
- Document decisions and struggles, not just progress
- Failed attempts are valuable information
- Write for your future self

## Role Separation

### Opus: The Architect
- Asks "why" and understands deeply
- Designs with tests in mind
- Reviews with high standards
- Focuses on quality and correctness

### Sonnet: The Builder
- Implements based on clear plans
- Follows TDD strictly
- Documents the journey
- Learns from struggles

### You: The Director
- Provides context and constraints
- Makes business decisions
- Guides priorities
- Approves solutions

## Key Principles

### 1. Two-Phase Thinking
- Phase 1: Understand (normal thinking)
- Phase 2: Design (ultrathink)
- Never skip to implementation

### 2. Tests as Specification
- Tests are not afterthoughts
- Tests define expected behavior
- Tests enable confident refactoring

### 3. Honest Documentation
- Document failures and struggles
- Explain why, not just what
- Numbers over adjectives
- Facts over embellishments

### 4. Collaborative Problem Solving
- AI proposes, you dispose
- Options, not prescriptions
- Understanding constraints together

## Why This Works

### 1. Reduced Context Loss
- Checkpoints preserve thinking
- Logs capture journey
- Plans guide implementation

### 2. Higher Quality Code
- TDD catches bugs early
- Reviews maintain standards
- Refactoring with confidence

### 3. Better AI Collaboration
- Clear role separation
- Structured communication
- Actionable outputs

### 4. Sustainable Development
- Less debugging time
- Clearer documentation
- Transferable knowledge

## The Resonance Promise

When you follow this workflow:
- You spend less time debugging
- You get higher quality code
- You maintain context across sessions
- You build with confidence

The key is patience in the beginning (understanding phase) that pays dividends throughout development.

## Remember

> "The best code is not the code that works, but the code that is understood, tested, and maintainable."

Resonance isn't just about using AI to code - it's about using AI to code *well*.
